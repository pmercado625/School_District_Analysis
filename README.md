# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of the school district's test scores via various metrics such as the different schools, grade levels, funding, etc. However, during the final phases of the project, it was discovered that some of the data needed to be invalidated due to academic dishonesty.

In the inidividual school analysis, one can notice a much more noticable difference in Thomas High School's exam grade's in particular. Surprisingly, because of this change, Thomas High school actually increased dramatically across the board. The overall passing rate seemed to be greatly increased. By extension, the district scores would increased due to the great change in one of the school's test scores. This also started to close the gap to the top schools such as Cabrera High School. Because of the increase in the test scores for the school, one can likely infer that comparitively between grades, the overall passing percentage and other metrics also increased for the ninth graders.
## Summary
Overall, the removal of these scores had a significant impact on the schools overall passing percentage as well as math/reading scores. By replacing the ninth grader's scores with NaN's the school rose in rank and came much closer to the top performing school. In term of statistics for school spending, school type, and school size, their individual categories would have increased due to the overall increase in test scores for the school itself.
