# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of the school district's test scores via various metrics such as the different schools, grade levels, funding, etc. However, during the final phases of the project, it was discovered that some of the data needed to be invalidated due to academic dishonesty.

[Original Vs Altered School Scores, Respectively]
- Individual school scores increased.
- Because of school scores increase, district scores would increased respectively.
- Increased performance relative to other schools.
- Math and reading scores by grade for 9th graders increased.
- Scores by specific spending category of Thomas High School increased ($631-645/Student).
- Scores by School size for respective size of Thomas High School increased.
- Scores by school type for respective type of Thomas High School increased (Charter).
## Summary
Overall, the removal of these scores had a significant impact on the schools overall passing percentage as well as math/reading scores. By replacing the ninth grader's scores with NaN's the school rose in rank and came much closer to the top performing school. In term of statistics for school spending, school type, and school size, their individual categories would have increased due to the overall increase in test scores for the school itself.
