# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of the school district's test scores via various metrics such as the different schools, grade levels, funding, etc. However, during the final phases of the project, it was discovered that some of the data needed to be invalidated due to academic dishonesty.
