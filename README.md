# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis of the school district's test scores via various metrics such as the different schools, grade levels, funding, etc. However, during the final phases of the project, it was discovered that some of the data needed to be invalidated due to academic dishonesty.

In the inidividual school analysis, one can notice a much more noticable difference in Thomas High School's exam grade's in particular. Because of this change Thomas High school is no longer the top scoring school in the district, with their overall passing percentage dropping by ~7%. The reading and math score percentage as well as the scores by school spending and size are all decreased.
## Summary
Overall, the removal of these scores had a significant impact on the schools overall passing percentage as well as math/reading scores. By replacing the ninth grader's scores with NaN's the school fell from the high performing scores to second place, losing to Cabrera High School
